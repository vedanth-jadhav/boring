# Caffeine backstop: restore the machine from the JSON journal alone.
# Runs from launchd (RunAtLoad + StartInterval 60, installed by install.sh)
# and from install.sh / uninstall.sh. Needs no Caffeine process and no Swift.
#
# Where it lives: install.sh copies this file into the app bundle at
# Caffeine.app/Contents/Resources/backstop.sh before signing the bundle, so
# the signature's resource seal covers it. The LaunchAgent's command line
# runs `codesign --verify --strict` on the bundle against the requirement
# pinned in the plist (for an ad-hoc build, the cdhash of that build) and
# execs this file only when that passes; an edited copy makes the check fail
# and the agent logs one line and runs nothing. Nothing executable is kept in
# Application Support (installs before this layout ran a writable copy from
# there; install.sh removes it once the new agent is loaded).
#
# Every run is one transaction under APP_SUPPORT/.recovery.lock, an flock(2)
# exclusive lock on the same file the app locks: read session.json and
# state.json, decide, undo, publish the new journal atomically, release. If
# the lock is not free within LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS the run does nothing and
# exits 75; launchd retries a minute later. The lock file is never unlinked
# or replaced here, so every party locks the same inode.
#
# Locking detail: the script opens the lock file on fd 9 and locks that fd
# with `lockf <fd>`. If a caller (uninstall.sh) already holds the lock and
# passes its handle down as fd 9, locking fd 9 again shares the caller's lock
# instead of deadlocking against it; fd 9 is accepted only if its inode is
# the lock file's inode.
#
# Decision, driven only by what the journal says was changed:
#   - session.json valid (endsAt in the future) and no --force: exit 0.
#   - state.json missing or clean: nothing is undone and nothing privileged
#     runs; an expired session.json is removed. Exit 0. Entries in
#     savedAudioOutputs alone count as clean (see below).
#   - state.json dirty: undo each journaled entry from the journal alone:
#       sleepDisabledByUs   -> sudo -n pmset -a disablesleep 0
#       lowPowerSetByUs     -> sudo -n pmset -b lowpowermode 0
#       frozenProcesses     -> SIGCONT, but only to a pid verified to be the
#                              process the app froze. Entries that record
#                              startedAtMicros are handed to the installed
#                              app binary (BORING_CAFFEINE_BIN --resume-frozen
#                              <seconds>) in one call with a time limit, one
#                              line per entry on its standard input. For
#                              each entry in turn it does one kernel lookup
#                              (start time to the microsecond, boot session,
#                              stopped state) immediately followed by that
#                              entry's SIGCONT; this script never signals
#                              such an entry itself. The binary runs only
#                              when the bundle's Info.plist declares the
#                              interface version this script speaks
#                              (CaffeineResumeFrozenVersion), and it keeps
#                              the lock on fd 9 until it exits, which it does
#                              by itself after <seconds>. When the binary is
#                              missing, does not declare that version, cannot
#                              run, times out, or answers anything but one
#                              documented line per entry, those entries are
#                              kept and not signaled. An entry
#                              without startedAtMicros (an older build) is
#                              checked here instead: it must exist, be
#                              stopped, have started in this boot session at
#                              the journaled second (ps -o lstart) and belong
#                              to this user. A pid observed gone, running, or
#                              not matching is cleared without a signal. A pid
#                              that cannot be observed (ps fails or prints
#                              something unparseable) is kept. In both paths
#                              an entry from another boot session is cleared

#                              would only fill the log. They are logged once
#                              when this run removes a session or undoes

#                              Nothing to undo and not dirty: never read for
#                              an undo here, and kept as they are for the
#                              app, with one change. Before this run
#                              switches Low Power Mode off, a record of the
#                              kept entry gets this boot's
#                              kern.bootsessionuuid (empty if it cannot be
#                              read) as keptDisplayUnderLowPowerBoot, in a
#                              journal published first, so the app takes no
#                              reading of that entry in this boot as the
#                              user's level while the panel comes back from
#                              the mode, even if the journal written after
#                              the undo is lost. If that journal cannot be
#                              published, the mode is left on and kept for
#                              retry. Their types are checked, and the three
#                              keys about the kept entry are also read from
#                              the file's text as the app reads it
#                              (record_text_problems): at the top level, with
#                              escapes in keys decoded. A number the app
#                              cannot decode, one of these keys found twice
#                              there, or text the check cannot follow makes
#                              the journal malformed.
#       appNapOverrides     -> NSAppSleepDisabled the app set to YES in an
#                              agent app's preferences, with the value it had
#                              before: defaults write <bundleId>
#                              NSAppSleepDisabled -bool <previous>, or
#                              defaults delete <bundleId> NSAppSleepDisabled
#                              when the key was absent. A delete that fails
#                              counts as done only when defaults read then
#                              says the key does not exist; a read that
#                              fails any other way proves nothing and the
#                              entry stays.
#     A flag is cleared only after its undo succeeded. Unknown keys survive.
#     Exit 0 only when the journal is clean afterwards; otherwise exit 1 so
#     the failure is visible and the next periodic run retries.
#   - state.json unreadable, not a JSON object, or with a known key of the
#     wrong type: nothing is touched, exit 1.
#   - session.json present but not a session: readable, but not the shape
#     the app's Session decoder accepts (session_shape_problems). It is
#     treated as expired. Once the journal is clean (already, or after the
#     undo above succeeded) the file is renamed to
#     session.json.unreadable-<UTC stamp>, never deleted or overwritten, so
#     the next run sees no session. While the journal stays dirty it stays.
#   - session.json present but not readable at all (permissions, I/O), or
#     not a regular file (a FIFO or device is never opened: open(2) could
#     block while this run holds the lock): its end time is unknown, and
#     sleep is never held without a deadline that can be enforced, so it is
#     treated as expired and the journal is undone as above. The file is
#     never opened, read or removed: it may have been a valid session. Once
#     the journal is clean it is renamed aside like a malformed one, so its
#     bytes stay as evidence and no later run, of this script or the app,
#     can read it back as a session that was already treated as ended. A
#     state.json that is not a regular file is malformed.
#
# Limitation: for an entry without startedAtMicros the shell compares process
# start time to the second only. For every entry a lookup and a signal are
# still two operations, in the app binary as here; the binary does each
# entry's lookup right before that entry's signal, never all lookups first.
#
# --force: treat the session as expired even if endsAt is in the future
# (used by install.sh / uninstall.sh to end a stale session deliberately).

# came in time.
# A command still running after SIGTERM is never SIGKILLed: killing sudo
# would orphan a root pmset that could change power state later, outside any
# transaction. Its supervisor keeps waiting and so keeps the lock, and the
# pid is logged for manual intervention. The caller must then end the
# transaction (stop_transaction): no later undo command may run beside a live
# one, and the journal stays as it was. Every later app start and backstop
# run is refused as "lock held" until that command ends. A missing status
# ends the transaction the same way: nothing here can tell whether the
# command still runs, and stopping is the safe side.
# Each call gets its own status files (.backstop.<this run's pid>.<call>.pid
# and .rc), so a status can never be read as another command's. The .pid file
# is for the log only. Nothing signals the pid read from it: by the time it
# is read the supervisor may have reaped the command, and the number may
# belong to another process. A call that ended removes its files; a call that
# returned 125 leaves them to its live supervisor. The first call of a run
# that took the lock on its own handle removes what earlier runs left: their
# supervisors kept the lock while they lived, so all of them have ended. A
# run that shares its caller's lock (fd 9) skips that: an earlier run under

# The supervisor ignores SIGTERM and SIGHUP, so neither the end of this run,
# killed or not, nor either signal sent to its whole process group frees the
# lock while the command runs. launchd signals what is left of a job's
# process group once the job's main process has exited, unless the job sets
# AbandonProcessGroup, which this agent does not. SIGINT and SIGQUIT are
# ignored already, as in every background job of a script. SIGKILL cannot be
# ignored: a supervisor killed with it frees the lock even if its command is
# still running. The command gets back the SIGTERM and SIGHUP actions this
# script started with (the defaults, under launchd), so it still stops on
# SIGTERM.
# The command is the supervisor's only job, so it stays in the supervisor's
# job list until the supervisor has reaped it, and signal_job (see
# run_app_bounded) sends SIGTERM by jobspec: to the command or, once bash has
# reaped it, to nothing, never to a process that reused its pid. At the limit
# the command gets SIGTERM (sudo relays it to pmset and waits for it), then
# KILL_GRACE_SECONDS; it never gets SIGKILL. <base>.rc gets one line:
# "exit <status>" when the command ended within the limit, "term" when it
# ended within the grace, "alive" when it was still running then. After
# "alive" the supervisor goes on waiting and logs the command's exit.
# errexit is off here: a failed write must not end the supervisor while its
# command still runs.

# Run the app binary's --resume-frozen check (see resume_via_app) with the
# same time limit, standard input from app_answer_dir/in and standard output
# to app_answer_dir/out. This shell starts the binary as its own background
# job and is the only process that signals it; no supervisor stands between
# them. Bash reaps a finished child on its own (in its SIGCHLD handler), so a
# signal sent by pid could reach whatever process gets that pid next. Each
# signal therefore names the job (%+) once signal_job has checked that %+ is
# this pid: bash's kill looks the job up with SIGCHLD blocked and signals it
# only if bash has not reaped it yet, and a child that has not been reaped
# keeps its pid, as a zombie at worst. The exit status is read with wait only
# after the job has left bash's running list. Unlike a power command this is
# our own unprivileged binary, so when SIGTERM does not end it within
# KILL_GRACE_SECONDS it gets SIGKILL: from then on it runs no more of its own
# code and so cannot send another signal.
# The binary inherits fd 9, so the recovery lock stays held for as long as it
# runs, also after this shell is gone: a run killed mid-call leaves no helper
# that could resume a process a later session froze while the lock was free.
# The binary ends itself after its lifetime argument (resume_via_app passes
# COMMAND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS + KILL_GRACE_SECONDS), so such a helper frees the
# lock on its own. Returns the binary's exit status, or 124 when it did not
# finish in time. The function's stderr is /dev/null because bash reports a
# job that a signal ended ("Terminated: 15") on its own stderr; the log says

# 1e-400, into 0.0, reads 1., .5, +1 and other JSON5 forms the app refuses,
# and keeps the last of two copies of a key where the app's JSONDecoder keeps
# the first. The text is read the way the app reads it. Only keys of the
# top-level object count, with their \u escapes decoded, so
# "keptDisplayReadL\u0069t" is that key. Every value is stepped over whole: a
# string to its closing quote, an object or array to its closing bracket. So
# a saved audio name or UID, or a nested object, that holds such a key, a \u
# escape or a bad number holds no record. Each of the two numbers must be
# null or a JSON number a Swift Float holds: not above about 3.4028236e38, and
# either 0 in every digit or not so small that it rounds to 0 (below about
# 7.0065e-46). The range is read from the decimal exponent and the first 9
# significant digits, a little stricter than the app (from 3.40282356e38 and
# up to 7.01e-46), where no brightness lies. A string, object or array there
# is left to the type check. Also refused: one of the three keys found more
# than once at the top level, since plutil checks and republishes the last
# copy; a key with an escape JSON does not have, such as \x41, which plutil
# reads as A; and a top level this reader cannot follow, such as a key
# without quotes, a comment, a byte order mark other than UTF-8's, or a NUL
# byte. UTF-16 and UTF-32, which the app also reads, have NUL bytes, and the
# shell drops them from the text, which would turn such a file into other
# characters. Text outside ASCII cannot spell the keys, even under the
# decoder's Unicode equivalence, so a file with neither "keptDisplay" nor a
# backslash in it has none of them and is not read further. Any of these
